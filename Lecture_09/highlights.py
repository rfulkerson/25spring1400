# When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cupcakes. 
# A squirrel party is successful when the number of cupcakes is 
#   between 40 and 60, inclusive. Unless it is the weekend, in which
#   case there is no upper bound on the number of cupcakes. 
# Input the number of cupcakes and if it's the weekend (y/n) and then
#   determine if it's a successful squirrel party with appropriate output.
#
# Adapted from https://codingbat.com/prob/p137202

# cupcakes = int(input("How many cupcakes? "))
# weekend = input("Weekend (y/n)? ")
# 
# # Using chained operators for range testing
# 
# if 40 <= cupcakes <= 60:
#     print("Successful dang squirrel party!")
# elif 40 <= cupcakes and weekend == "y":
#     print("Successful dang squirrel party on the weekend!")
# else:
#     print("Failed squirrel party!")
# 
# # Using logical operators and consistent relational operators <=
# 
# if 40 <= cupcakes and cupcakes <= 60:
#     print("Successful dang squirrel party!")
# elif 40 <= cupcakes and weekend == "y":
#     print("Successful dang squirrel party on the weekend!")
# else:
#     print("Failed squirrel party!")
#     
# # Another way to approach it that places the importance on the variable
# #   being tested even though it ends up using two different operators    
# 
# if cupcakes >= 40 and cupcakes <= 60:
#     print("Successful dang squirrel party!")
# elif 40 <= cupcakes and weekend == "y":
#     print("Successful dang squirrel party on the weekend!")
# else:
#     print("Failed squirrel party!")

# Given an input year, determine and output if the year is a leap year.
# Leap years are divisible by 4 and not by 100 or are divisible by 400.

# Leap years: 2024, 2028, and 2000
# Not leap years: 2022, 1900, 1800, 2100, 2021

#year = int(input("What is the year? "))

#if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
#    print(f"{year} is a leap year!")
#else:
#    print(f"{year} is NOT a leap year!")
