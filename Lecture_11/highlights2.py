# Write a program that plays a number guessing game.
# The computer will pick a random number between 1 and 100
# and then the user tries to guess the number. Based on
# their input, the program should provide feedback and if
# the user's guess is too high or too low.




# As an added feature, output if their input is out of range 1-100.

# As an added-added feature, tell the user how may guesses it took
# them to guess the number.

# As an added-added-added feature, limit the user to only 8 guesses.
