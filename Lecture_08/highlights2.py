# You have a lottery ticket that shows three single-digit numbers.
# The values of the numbers determine how much you win. 

# Input three numbers a, b, and c and determine how much the lottery 
# ticket winnings are based on these conditions:
#     If all three values a, b, and c are equal to 2, you win $10.
#     Otherwise, if all three values a, b, and c are equal, you win $5.
#     Otherwise, if the b and c values are different than a, you win $1.
#     If none of those conditions are met, you win $0.
