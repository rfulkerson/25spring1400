# We want to allow the user to enter words, one at a time, and
# count the frequency of the occurrence of words found. 
# The user will enter a punctuation mark (period, exclamation
# point, or question mark) to end the loop.

# Write the program and output the sorted results like you see to the right. 

# Example input of The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog ? on
# separate lines could generate the output to the right.
